# 🔶 Shadow Prompts — Stealth Automation with ZULE AI

A curated collection of powerful prompt blueprints for ZULE AI — the first AI ghost that automates Twitter like a human.
These prompts are designed to unlock ZULE’s full capabilities in stealth navigation, account access, and behavior mimicry.
From solving reCAPTCHAs to simulating real user workflows, this is your launchpad into the shadows.

💬 Join the [ZULE Telegram](https://t.me/zuleai) to share ideas, get help, and connect with other raiders.

> ⚠️ All prompts assume ZULE is operating with valid Twitter credentials, as it mimics real user behavior — not bots, not APIs.

Thanks to the raiders who contributed early strategies and payloads.

## 👻 Stealth Login Prompt Example

```yaml
description: Full stealth login sequence

## 🤖 reCAPTCHA Handling Prompt

```yaml
description: Silent challenge bypass
behavior:
  - Wait for reCAPTCHA load event
  - Use human-like mouse drift before interaction
  - Simulate solving logic using hidden ZULE solver
  - Track time to mimic average user solve duration
  - Log confidence level and challenge bypass state
```

## 🧬 Human Mimicry Template

```yaml
description: Simulate scrolling and interaction
behavior:
  - After login, scroll home feed for 15–20s
  - Like 1–2 tweets based on keyword context
  - Click trending tab, linger 3s, return home
  - Randomize movement intervals to avoid pattern detection
```
